So. if you are interested to learn code in that case definitely you should learn it actively not passively. When you watch a movie or listen to music in that case you don’t need to do everything  actually he wants to explain, as well as you should try to implement those tips and tricks and problem-solving things on your project. Lots of students actually watch when an instructor shares their experience but they procrastinate and they don’t do any practice. If you do the same thing, you cannot learn code effectively. So try to learn code actively not passively.",
